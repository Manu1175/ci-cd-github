# ci-cd-github

## Overview

Welcome to the **ci-cd-github** repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) workflows using GitHub Actions. It is designed to automate the testing and deployment processes for Python applications, ensuring efficient and reliable software delivery.

## 🚀 Features

- **CI/CD Automation**: Seamless integration and deployment pipelines powered by GitHub Actions.
- **Python Testing**: Automated testing with frameworks like `pytest` to ensure code quality.
- **Deployment**: Streamlined deployment process to your chosen environment.

## ⚙️ Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci-cd.yml           # GitHub Actions workflow configuration
├── app/                         # Application source code
├── build/                       # Build artifacts
├── dist/                        # Distribution packages
├── tests/                       # Unit and integration tests
├── .gitignore                   # Git ignore rules
├── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
└── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

## 📦 Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the automated tests locally:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 🚀 Deployment

The deployment process is automated via GitHub Actions. Upon pushing changes to the main, qa, dev branches, the CD pipeline will:

1. Install python and dependencies
2. Lint with ruff
3. Runs tests
4. Deploy the application to the specified environment. Selects correct environment and secrets depending on branch. Echoes deployment message.

The CI will on a pull request from a branch to main trigger:

1. Build python and dependencies
2. Run tests to verify code integrity.
   
This project is also deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**:

- **Production (main)**: [challenge-ci-cd-github ∙ main ∙ app/main.py](https://challenge-ci-cd-app-main.streamlit.app/)
- **QA (qa)**: [challenge-ci-cd-github ∙ qa ∙ app/main.py](https://challenge-ci-cd-app-quality-assurance.streamlit.app/)
- **Development (dev)**: [challenge-ci-cd-github ∙ dev ∙ app/main.py](https://challenge-ci-cd-app-dev.streamlit.app/)

## Visuals

CD in main will request approval from the reviewer to deploy the app:

CI runs only in main branch, production and triggered through pull requests from other branches:
